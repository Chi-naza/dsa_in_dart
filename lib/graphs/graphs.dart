    Graphs
      A graph is a data structure that captures relationships between objects. 
      Itâ€™s made up of vertices connected by edges.
      Graphs are an instrumental data structure that can model a wide range of things: 
       a. webpages on the internet, 
       b. the migration patterns of birds, 
       c. even protons in the nucleus of an atom

    Types of Graph
      - Weighted Graphs: In a weighted graph, every edge has a weight associated with it that represents the cost of using this edge.
      - Directed Graphs: This is a graph where the egdes have direction, and this can be restrictive because an edge may only permit traversal in one direction.
      - Undirected Graphs: It is a directed-graph where all the edges are bi-drectional.
