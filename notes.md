## Data Structures (DS)
The study of DS is for efficiency - given a particular amount of data, what is the best way to store it to achieve a particular goal.

## Scalability of Algorithms
For algorithms, scalability refers to how the algorithm performs in terms of execution time and memory usage as the input size increases.

## Time Complexity
Time complexity is a measure of the time required to run an algorithm as the input size increases.
